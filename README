NytRam Editor to take a stab at creating a better Python IDE with improved auto-complete and interactive programming styles.

|Python Auto Complete|
----------------------

Goal for Python auto-complete is to get it to work with variables passed into functions.
Since Python is typeless the few IDEs with auto complete I've used don't provide any help for function arguments.

The plan for Nyt Owl's auto complete is to have the IDE search all Python files in user-defined directories,
and when the user is editting the function it will take a look at all the objects passed to the function and
provide auto complete for all the functions the objects have in commmon.
